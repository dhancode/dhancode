# 🧠 Data Science Portfolio

Welcome to my **Data Science Portfolio**!  
This repository is a curated collection of projects that demonstrate my skills in data analysis, machine learning, data visualization, and end-to-end problem-solving using real-world datasets.

## 👨‍💻 About Me

I'm an aspiring Data Scientist with a passion for extracting insights from data and building intelligent systems. My work blends statistics, programming, and domain knowledge to solve meaningful problems.

## 🚀 Technologies & Tools

- 🐍 **Python** (NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- 📊 **Data Visualization** (Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly)
- 🧠 **Machine Learning** (Scikit-learn, XGBoost, TensorFlow/Keras)
- 💾 **Data Wrangling** (Pandas, SQL)
- 🧮 **Math & Statistics** (Regression, Classification, Clustering, Probability, Hypothesis Testing)
- 📈 **Notebooks** (Jupyter, Google Colab)
